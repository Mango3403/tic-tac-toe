# Running the server locally

You'll need two terminal windows open to be able to run this. One for the
client, and one for the server:

**Running the server**

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

**Important files to have look at**

- [registering room](server/index.ts#L19)
- [room and state implementation](server/rooms/tictactoe.ts)

## JavaScript / PixiJS

The JavaScript/PixiJS example uses:

- [colyseus](http://colyseus.io)
- [webpack 4.x](http://npmjs.com/package/webpack)
- [pixi.js v4](http://npmjs.com/package/pixi.js)

**Running the JavaScript/PixiJS client**

```
cd javascript-pixi
npm install
npm start
```

**Important files to have look at**

- [room connection](frontend/src/screens/GameScreen.js#L36)
